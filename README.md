1. The first change that I made and issue I noticed was the names of all the variables had no description
   what so ever. I changed the names of the variables and made them far more descriptive so the code is easier to read.

2. the next thing that I needed to change was the code repetition. Not only was there repeated code in the each
   event listener but there was also no need to have an event listener for each button. So I condensed all the event listners into one using a div element in the html code to organize this and then I created and updateUI function to handle the original repeated code.

3. after I did the last changes there was no need to have the extra getElementId for the html elements so I got rid of those only needing to add one which was the buttonController variable.

Other than that I dont think there was anything else that needed to change.
